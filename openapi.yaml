  description: '# Introduction

    These are the public APIs to enable implementing a custom client interface to
    the Glean system.


    # Usage guidelines

    This API is evolving fast. Glean will provide advance notice of any planned backwards
    incompatible changes along

    with a 6-month sunset period for anything that requires developers to adopt the
    new versions.


    # SDK

    Client bindings for the API can be generated for most popular languages (Python,
    Java, NodeJS, etc). To do so:


    Download the OpenAPI specification for the API, by clicking on one of the following
    options:

    1. [Download JSON specification](https://api.redocly.com/registry/bundle/glean/Glean%20Client%20API%20SDK%20source/v1/openapi.json?branch=main&download=true)

    2. [Download YAML specification](https://api.redocly.com/registry/bundle/glean/Glean%20Client%20API%20SDK%20source/v1/openapi.yaml?branch=main&download=true)


    Use [openapi-generator-cli](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator-cli)
    to generate bindings for your language of choice, for example:

    ```bash shell

    $ npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@latest generate -i client_api.yaml -g
    go

    ```


    To see available languages:

    ```bash shell

    $ npx @openapitools/openapi-generator-cli@latest list

    ```


    Determine the host you need to connect to. This will be the URL of the backend
    for your Glean deployment, for example, customer-be.glean.com
